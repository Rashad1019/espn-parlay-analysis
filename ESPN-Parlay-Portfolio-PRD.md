# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
### Title: ESPN Parlay Analysis – GitHub Portfolio Showcase

---

## Objective
Package, document, and promote the ESPN Parlay Analysis project as a professional, high-visibility portfolio item on GitHub. The goal is to appeal to both technical audiences (data scientists, engineers) and non-technical decision-makers (recruiters, hiring managers), and to reuse this structure for future portfolio projects.

---

## Scope
Transform existing notebooks, markdown files, and analysis into a public-facing GitHub repository with supporting collateral (README, blog, resume entry, etc.).

---

## Features & Deliverables

### 1. GitHub Repository Structure
**Goal:** Create a clean, professional layout.
- `/` (root)
  - `README.md` – Project landing page
  - `project_overview.ipynb` – Business-focused notebook
  - `espn_parlay_analysis.ipynb` – Technical implementation
  - `requirements.txt` – Dependencies
  - `task-list.md` – Development checklist (optional)
  - `ESPN-Parlay-PRD.md` – Product requirements (this file)
  - `/data/` (optional, anonymized sample CSVs if shareable)

---

### 2. README.md
**Goal:** Create a dual-purpose landing page for:
- Non-technical readers → directed to `project_overview.ipynb`
- Technical readers → guided to `espn_parlay_analysis.ipynb`

Includes:
- Project summary
- Key achievements
- Repository navigation
- Technologies used
- Getting started instructions
- Results
- Contact info

---

### 3. Jupyter Notebooks
**Goal:** Separate strategic and technical content.

- `project_overview.ipynb`:
  - Executive summary
  - Problem framing
  - High-level methodology
  - Visual highlights of results
  - Business implications

- `espn_parlay_analysis.ipynb`:
  - Data cleaning
  - Implied vs. true probability
  - Expected value
  - Visualizations
  - Strategy comparisons

---

### 4. requirements.txt
**Goal:** Support reproducibility.
- Confirm and freeze versions of packages used:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

---

### 5. LinkedIn & Blog Promotion
**Goal:** Drive visibility to the repo.

- LinkedIn Post:
  - Key result (e.g., "Improved parlay success rate from 12% → 18%")
  - Visuals from the notebook
  - Link to repo

- Blog Post:
  - Story-style structure: Problem → Process → Payoff
  - Diagrams/plots explaining value
  - Summary for data science & betting audience

---

### 6. Resume Entry
**Goal:** Summarize project in 3–4 bullets with measurable impact.

Example:
- Built a parlay betting optimizer using Python and statistical modeling
- Increased strategy success rate by 22% through probability calibration
- Reduced risk by 15% with automated Kelly Criterion logic
- Automated analysis workflow reduced manual review time by 80%

---

### 7. Interview Talking Points
**Goal:** Prepare discussion of:
- Problem-solving strategy
- Use of probability, EV, and optimization
- Code structure and testing
- Communication (explaining risk models to non-technical users)
- Reusability for other sports markets

---

## Success Criteria
- Repository is organized, readable, and error-free
- README clearly guides users
- Notebooks run end-to-end without modification
- Project shows measurable impact
- Shared on LinkedIn and optionally blogged
- Added to resume and used in interview settings

---

## Constraints
- Must remain open-source, Jupyter Notebook-based
- No proprietary data or credentials
- Only use dependencies from requirements.txt
- Must run on base Python + Jupyter environment


## We will complete this going task by task and not advancing until I say so and if the task has subtasks we go subtasks by subtasks the point we will not advance until I say so insuring we are only doing thing at time. 

## After Every two tasks completed you will remind that we need to check off the tasks we have completed.
